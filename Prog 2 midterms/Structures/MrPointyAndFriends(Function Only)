/**
    Function: getMrPointyAndFriends()
    Description: The function will get all points with the same cluster (location) in the cartesian plane. Mr Pointy is the first index in the collection followed by the others.
    Param: points - a collection of points starting with Mr. Pointy followed by the others.
    Return: a collection of Mr Pointy and with his friends. Still Mr Pointy will still be in the first index follwed by his friends.
